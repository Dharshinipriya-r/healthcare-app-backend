- Data flow: Client -> Auth Interceptor -> API Service -> State Service -> Component Render

1) File Map (TS Only)
Core Files:

- app.routes.ts: Main routing configuration
- app.config.ts: Application-wide configuration

Feature Modules:
- auth/
  * login.ts: Handles user authentication
  * register.ts: New user registration
  * forgot-password.ts: Password recovery flow
  * reset-password.ts: Password reset implementation
  * auth.guard.ts: Route protection logic

- appointments/
  * book/book-appointment.ts: Appointment booking logic
  * doctor-search/doctor-search.ts: Doctor search functionality
  * my-appointments/my-appointments.ts: User appointments management

- doctor/
  * schedule/schedule.ts: Doctor's schedule management
  * upcoming/upcoming.ts: Upcoming appointments view
  * waitlist/doctor-waitlist.ts: Waitlist management
  * update-profile/update-profile.ts: Doctor profile updates

- admin/
  * admin.ts: Admin dashboard core logic
  * average-rating.pipe.ts: Rating calculation utility

Services:
- auth.service.ts: Authentication operations
- appointment.service.ts: Appointment management
- doctor.service.ts: Doctor-related operations
- user.service.ts: User profile management
- admin-analytics.service.ts: Admin dashboard analytics

2) Bootstrap & Modules
- main.ts bootstraps the application with environment configurations
- Key providers:
  * AuthService: Root-level authentication
  * AppointmentService: Appointment management
  * UserService: User state management
  * HTTP_INTERCEPTORS: Auth header injection

3) Routing & Navigation
- Core routes:
  * /login, /register: Public routes
  * /appointments/*: Protected patient routes
  * /doctor/*: Protected doctor routes
  * /admin/*: Protected admin routes
- Guards:
  * AuthGuard: Checks authentication state
  * DoctorGuard: Validates doctor role
  * PatientGuard: Validates patient role
  * AdminGuard: Validates admin role

4) Components (TS logic only)
Login Component:
- Purpose: User authentication
- Key methods:
  * onSubmit(): Handles login form submission
  * togglePassword(): Password visibility toggle
- State: Uses AuthService for auth state

DoctorSearch Component:
- Purpose: Search and filter available doctors
- Inputs: searchFilters
- Outputs: selectedDoctor
- Uses: DoctorService for data fetching
- Change Detection: OnPush

BookAppointment Component:
- Purpose: Appointment scheduling
- Key methods:
  * checkAvailability(): Checks doctor's availability
  * bookSlot(): Books appointment
  * addToWaitlist(): Adds to waiting list
- State: Local form state + AppointmentService

5) Services & Data Access
AuthService:
- Purpose: Authentication management
- Methods:
  * login(credentials): Observable<User>
  * logout(): void
  * refreshToken(): Observable<string>
- Storage: JWT in localStorage
- Provided in: root

AppointmentService:
- Purpose: Appointment operations
- Methods:
  * book(appointment): Observable<Appointment>
  * cancel(id): Observable<void>
  * getUpcoming(): Observable<Appointment[]>
- Caching: Uses shareReplay for active appointments
- Error handling: Centralized error interceptor

6) HTTP & Interceptors
- API base URL: Configured in environment.ts
- AuthInterceptor:
  * Adds Bearer token
  * Handles 401/403 responses
  * Triggers token refresh
- ErrorInterceptor:
  * Global error handling
  * Retry logic for network issues
  * Error notification dispatch

7) AuthN/AuthZ
- JWT-based authentication
- Token storage in localStorage
- Auto-refresh mechanism
- Role-based route protection
- Guards check both authentication and role authorization

8) State Management
Service-based state using RxJS:
- BehaviorSubject for user state
- ReplaySubject for appointments
- Derived streams with distinctUntilChanged
- Optimistic updates pattern

9) Forms (Reactive)
Appointment Booking Form:
- FormGroup with nested FormArrays
- Custom validators for date/time
- Async validator for availability check
- Error states mapped to user-friendly messages

10) Reusables
- AverageRatingPipe: Calculates doctor ratings
- Types:
  * Appointment
  * User
  * Doctor
  * Schedule
- Utils:
  * date formatters
  * validation helpers
  * error mappings

11) Error Handling & Logging
- Centralized error handler
- HTTP error interceptor
- Form validation errors
- User notification service
- Console logging service

12) Performance & Best Practices
- OnPush change detection
- Unsubscribe using takeUntil
- trackBy functions for ngFor
- Lazy loaded feature modules
- Memoized selectors
- shareReplay for caching

13) Testing Overview
Key specs:
- AuthService: Login flow, token management
- AppointmentService: CRUD operations
- Guards: Role checks
- Components: Form submission, error states

14) Interview Q&A
Q: How is authentication handled?
A: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens, stored in localStorage, injected via interceptor

Q: Explain the appointment booking flow
A: User selects doctor -> checks availability -> submits form -> optimistic UI update -> API confirmation

Q: How do you handle concurrent appointments?
A: Optimistic locking + version checking on backend, retry pattern on conflict

Q: Why use OnPush in DoctorSearch?
A: Large list of doctors, immutable data pattern, better performance

Q: How do you handle offline scenarios?
A: Error interceptor with retry logic, local state caching, user notifications

15) Glossary
- Interceptor: HTTP pipeline processor
- Guard: Route access controller
- JWT: JSON Web Token for auth
- BehaviorSubject: State container
- shareReplay: Caching operator
- takeUntil: Cleanup operator
- FormGroup: Form container
- OnPush: Change detection strategy

16) Quick Trace: End-to-End Flow
1. User -> login.component.ts -> auth.service.ts
2. AuthInterceptor adds token
3. Route guard checks authorization
4. Component loads -> service fetches data
5. State updates -> view renders
6. Error interceptor handles failures

17) TODO/Assumptions
- Angular version assumed from structure
- State management approach inferred
- Error handling strategy assumed
- Testing coverage unclear
